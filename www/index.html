  <h2>What is Phoenix?</h2>
  <p>
    Phoenix is going to be a game console that uses computer hardware as a base.
	It will have an operating system (OS) that is specifically designed to run a single
	program  or game. A storage device such as a CD or zip disk will be used as a game
	'cartridge'. The cartridge will hold the game and the OS in a single executable that
	will be launched during the computer's booting process.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Phoenix?</h2>
  <p>
    The name "Phoenix" comes from the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_%28mythology%29">mythical bird</a>
    that burns and then rises anew from its ashes. Just as with its namesake, the
    Phoenix operating system rose from an earlier, unsuccessful attempt at
    building an operating system started by the <a
    href="http://solstice.vtc.edu/">VTC Computer Club</a>. This older system was
    called "KOS" which was short for the "K Operating System" (no relation to the
    KDE desktop system). Nobody knows why the name KOS was choosen; most likely
    it was completely arbitrary.
  </p>
  <p>Thus Phoenix rose from the ashes of KOS.</p>
  <h2>Who is involved?</h2>
  <p><b>Peter Chapin</b> - Instructor.</p>
  <p><b>Nicholas Guertin</b> - Message passing in the kernel and testing.</p>
  <p><b>Curtis Aube</b> - Video module, game pad module and bootloader.</p>
  <p><b>Wei Yao Lin</b> - Thread handling, keyboard module and generic input module.</p>
  <h2>Why are we doing it?</h2>
  <p>
    This project is for our Computer Engineering Degree senior project course: <b>CIS-4712</b>.
	Our hope is that this project could be expanded upon in later years by other students
	in similar degrees. This project could be a great instrument for learning about the
	intricacies of how operating systems work.
