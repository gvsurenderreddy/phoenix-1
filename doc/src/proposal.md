We propose to create a console game system. We will be using computer hardware
as a base. The first step will be to create a simple bootable OS. The OS will
also contain control and display libraries for the games. The second part will
be a game stored along with the OS on a single disk. The game will be linked
directly to the OS so that we will not need to create a file system. Other
disks could be created with other games installed, creating the console feel.
