Phoenix
=======

Phoenix is a microkernel (message passing) operating system for 16 bit, real mode x86 processors
running in a PC architecture. It is intended to be used as a game console although other
applications are also possible. Phoenix was the BS.CPE senior project of Nick Guertin, Curtis
Aube, and Wei Yao Lin during the 2007/2008 academic year.
